Yo! Nice to meet you - I'm Tobe Osakwe, an young and upcoming software engineer/musician.

I'm the creator of Angel, a server-side framework for rapid and secure Web application development.
In addition to that, I've published over 300 open-source software projects on the Internet,
and have a record out on Spotify and other music streaming services.

I also have experience with campus leadership (FSU '21), writing and public speaking.

My current goal is to make the Forbes 30 under 30. But I'm a far ways off from that for now.

Contact me here via DM or on my site: https://thosakwe.com

P.S. I also do freelance Web and mobile development, for the lowwwww.
